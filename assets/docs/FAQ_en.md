# FAQ

### Q: Why is my mouse moving uncontrollably?
A: The script simulates mouse operations. Please do not move the mouse while the script is running. If you need to stop it, perform a specific operation (e.g., move the mouse quickly to a corner) or use the stop hotkey.

### Q: Why does it not recognize images?
A: Please ensure the game resolution is 1920x1080 and the game window is not obscured. Also, check if HDR or other filters are enabled.

### Q: How to update?
A: Use the built-in updater or download the latest version from GitHub and overwrite the files.

### Q: Is it safe?
A: This software simulates user inputs and does not inject code into the game client. However, use it at your own risk.

### Q: Can I run it in the background?
A: Yes, if you use the "Cloud Game" mode or the "Background" feature provided in the documentation within a proper environment.
