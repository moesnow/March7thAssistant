## Feature Overview

- **Daily Tasks**: Stamina recovery, daily training, claiming rewards, commissions, and farming.
- **Weekly Tasks**: History of Forgotten Echoes, Simulated Universe, and Forgotten Hall.
- Push notifications for the completion of daily tasks, automatically triggered at 4 AM or when stamina recovers to a specified value.
- Sound notifications upon task completion, with the option to automatically close the game or shut down the computer.

> The Simulated Universe feature utilizes the [Auto_Simulated_Universe](https://github.com/CHNZYX/Auto_Simulated_Universe) project, while farming employs the [Fhoe-Rail](https://github.com/linruowuyin/Fhoe-Rail) project.
